# Station Map Webpage
Displays a list of train stations by pulling in data from both the Wikipedia and Google Maps API. It takes this data and displays it using KnockoutJS declarative bindings.


## Getting Started
* Open "index.html" with a web browser. You'll need to ensure that you have scripts enabled for everything to function properly.
* You can update the "self.pins" observable array to add a new location to the map. You'll need to include a name, X and Y coordinate and a description.
